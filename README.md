Created a dynamic Consumer Complaint Data Analysis Dashboard that empowered the client to identify and prioritize key consumer issues across products and regions. The dashboard enabled the client to optimize communication channels, enhance customer experience, and strategically allocate resources based on data-driven insights. The use of timely response metrics and resolution categories further supported the client in maintaining high service standards and improving customer satisfaction outcomes.

Client requirements based on the data provided in the dashboard: 
1. Understanding Key Pain Points:
Client Requirement: Identify the most frequent consumer issues and the products/services that generate the highest volume of complaints.
Dashboard Insight: The "Complaints by Product" and "Complaints by Issue" sections provide clear visibility into the top problem areas, such as "Checking or savings accounts" and issues related to "Managing an account." The client can prioritize addressing these key pain points to enhance customer satisfaction.
2. Geographical Focus for Improvement
Client Requirement: Pinpoint regions with the highest complaint volumes to allocate resources more effectively and address regional-specific issues.
Dashboard Insight: The "Complaints by State" heatmap allows the client to quickly identify states with the highest complaint volumes. This helps in directing targeted interventions or marketing efforts in high-complaint areas.
3. Channel Optimization
Client Requirement: Determine which communication channels are most commonly used for complaints, ensuring that these channels are optimized for better customer service.
Dashboard Insight: The "Complaints by Sources" chart reveals that the web is the most utilized channel for lodging complaints. The client can focus on improving the web complaint interface and ensuring adequate staffing and response mechanisms for this channel.
4. Efficiency and Responsiveness
Client Requirement: Assess the efficiency of the complaint resolution process, particularly focusing on timely responses and successful resolution with customer satisfaction.
Dashboard Insight: The "Timely Response" (97%) and "Complaint Resolution Category" sections highlight the overall effectiveness of the support team. The client can use this data to ensure the maintenance of high responsiveness and explore strategies for increasing the percentage of cases resolved with monetary or non-monetary relief.
5. Customer Experience Enhancement
Client Requirement: Improve the overall customer experience by reducing the number of unresolved or unsatisfactory complaints.
Dashboard Insight: The "Closed with Monetary Relief" (14%) and "Dispute Category" charts show the outcomes of complaints and whether they led to customer satisfaction. The client can leverage this information to refine their resolution strategies, aiming for more cases to be resolved satisfactorily (e.g., increasing monetary or satisfactory non-monetary resolutions).
6. Monitoring Trends Over Time
Client Requirement: Track complaint trends over time to identify whether issues are increasing, decreasing, or remaining constant, and adjust strategies accordingly.
Dashboard Insight: The "Date Submitted" filter allows clients to analyze complaints over a specific period, helping them monitor whether recent changes in service, policies, or product offerings have led to improvements or declines in customer satisfaction.
7. Resource Allocation and Strategic Planning
Client Requirement: Use data to guide resource allocation and strategic planning, ensuring the most critical areas receive the necessary attention.
Dashboard Insight: By integrating insights from various sections (e.g., geographic hotspots, primary complaint channels, and key issues), the client can make informed decisions about where to allocate resources (e.g., improving staffing in specific regions or channels).
8. Enhanced Customer Relations
Client Requirement: Strengthen relationships with consumers by proactively addressing common complaints and preventing escalation.
Dashboard Insight: By focusing on common issues such as "Managing an account" or "Trouble during payment process," and tracking resolution categories, the client can develop proactive strategies to address these issues before they escalate.
